# Project Status

**Status date:** 2026-09-12

**Runtime:** 64-bit Python 3.14.7

**Completed milestones:** A — Repository Foundation; B — Historical Data System;
C — Point-in-Time Features and Elo

**Current milestone:** D — Probabilistic Models

**Exact next step:** 3.1 — implement naive and Elo benchmarks

## Implemented capabilities

- Installable `pl_platform` package using the `src/` layout.
- Typed, immutable environment configuration.
- Structured JSON logging with recursive key-based secret redaction.
- Local Ruff, strict mypy, pytest, branch coverage and dependency checks.
- Versioned Football-Data manifest with HTTPS host allowlisting.
- Immutable, checksum-verified, idempotent historical downloads.
- Typed Football-Data row parsing with retained additional source fields.
- Provider-independent fixture, score, statistics, team and season contracts.
- Explicit canonical alias resolution for 34 clubs; no fuzzy identity matching.
- Reviewed membership and promotion metadata for 11 seasons.
- Dataset-wide double-round-robin and season-integrity checks.
- Deterministic JSON Lines materialization with companion lineage manifests.
- Batch `--all` and single-entry ingestion commands.
- Immutable, versioned point-in-time feature-row contract.
- Deterministic feature-row identity with canonical and raw-source lineage.
- Structural predictor/training-label separation and temporal boundary checks.
- Deterministic exact-kickoff and conservative whole-date fixture batches.
- Pre-batch snapshots with post-batch result and statistic updates.
- Season-to-date and five-match result, goal, shot, foul and card features.
- Missing-statistic observation counts without fabricated zero values.
- Rest, congestion, venue, promoted-team and season-progress context.
- Atomic, deterministic feature JSON Lines with companion lineage manifests.
- Single-season and all-season feature-materialization command.
- Explicit leakage, temporal, missing-data, checksum and idempotency tests.
- Explicit five-match-weighted season-opening priors with previous-team,
  previous-league and fixed-baseline source policies.
- Point-in-time Elo prediction and batch-delayed updates with reviewed
  initialization, home advantage and season transition constants.
- Recursive historical-context checksums binding cross-season predictors to
  every verified predecessor.
- Immutable, versioned training-example contract with separate predictors and
  result/score target.
- Deterministic all-season training-dataset materialization with typed loading
  and complete feature, canonical, raw, manifest and registry provenance.

- Validated in-memory feature rows: 4,180.
- Materialized feature rows: 4,180.
- Predictor schema: `epl-pre-match` version 2 with 175 ordered predictors.
- Feature-row and feature-dataset schema versions: 2.

- Training targets: 1,853 home wins; 1,337 away wins; 990 draws.
- Training row and dataset schema versions: 1.
- Training SHA-256:
  `d002097c5ccd471eb0987ffc505b544bfcad41e7c73b483f2110badc79054844`.
- Canonical dataset schema version: 2.
- Raw data location: `data/raw/football-data/epl/<season>/E0.csv`.
- Canonical location:
  `data/interim/canonical/epl/<season>/fixtures.jsonl`.
- Training location:
  `data/processed/training/epl/2015-2016_to_2025-2026/training.jsonl`.
- Raw, interim and processed files are reproducible local artifacts and are
  ignored by Git.

## Last verified quality result

The Milestone C implementation passed the complete local suite:

- pytest: 173 passed.
- branch-aware coverage: 92.01% (minimum required: 90%).
- Ruff lint: passed.
- Ruff format check: passed.
- strict mypy: passed.
- package dependency check: passed.
- raw manifest verification returned `already_present` for all 11 seasons.
- canonical materialization returned `already_current` for all 11 seasons.
- all 4,180 canonical fixtures produced feature rows; rebuilding from reversed
  input order produced identical serialized in-memory rows per season.
- predictor schema version 2 rebuilt all 11 season datasets with a recursive
  historical-context checksum and 175 predictors per row.
- the Step 2.8 training dataset was regenerated from all 4,180 verified feature
  rows with the recorded SHA-256.
- the final all-season feature and training rerun returned `already_current`
  throughout with unchanged checksums.
- typed artifact loading confirmed 760 fixed-prior team appearances in the first
  window and, in each later season, 646 previous-team plus 114
  previous-league team appearances.

## Important project constraints

- Do not add GitHub Actions, YAML-based CI/CD or other CI/CD automation unless
  the user explicitly changes this decision.
- Use Python 3.14.7 and preserve the declared `>=3.14,<3.15` support window.
- Keep secrets in ignored local environment files; never commit `.env`.
- Raw provider files are immutable and ignored by Git.
- Never overwrite conflicting raw data. A provider correction requires a
  reviewed manifest change or a separately identified capture.
- Canonical team mappings are explicit. Unknown aliases must fail rather than be
  fuzzy-matched.
- Store canonical timestamps in UTC after interpreting Football-Data timestamps
  in `Europe/London`.
- Treat `date_only` fixtures on the same date as a simultaneous batch during
  point-in-time feature updates.
- Retained bookmaker columns are not automatically eligible model features.
- Preserve a strict separation between predictors, labels and provenance to
  prevent target leakage.
- Develop the backend and ML system before the frontend.

## Not implemented yet

- Model training, calibration or score modelling.
- Temporal cross-validation.
- Season simulation.
- PostgreSQL persistence or migrations.
- Current-season provider integration.
- FastAPI endpoints.
- Deployment or frontend code.

## Next step boundary

Step 3.1 implements naive and Elo benchmarks against explicit chronological
evaluation windows. It must define probabilistic metrics and simple acceptance
baselines without fitting the Step 3.2 logistic-regression model or treating
Elo expected score as an already calibrated three-way probability.
